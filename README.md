# Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python

In this project I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Diamonds dataset. This dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds. There are nearly **54,000** observations in this dataset. There are ten attributes, seven are numerical (continuous) and three are categorical (ordinal). 

The numerical variables are:
- price
- carat
- depth percentage
- table
- length
- width
- depth

The categorical variables are:
- cut
- color
- clarity
